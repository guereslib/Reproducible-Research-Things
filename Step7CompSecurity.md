### Step 7
## Computer Security

## Ensuring that your computer and network are secured means that you have far less a chance of a data breach or hack. 


Beginner
* Have good strong passwords and encrypt your computer's hard drive

Intermediate
* Get set up on a password manager

Advanced
* Let's ensure your lab/office is encrypted and practicing safe habits
Note:
The boss's computer is usually the most insecure

### Encrypt your computer
* Encryption- https://www.griffith.edu.au/about-griffith/cybersecurity/data-protection
* Win 10 Encryption: https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-bitlocker-encryption-windows-10
* Win 7 Encryption: https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=4794 (Call 55555 first and ask their advice as they can help you install this- it doesn't look as simple as Win 10)
* Mac OS https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204837

### Strong passwords

* Find out if your email has been compromised https://haveibeenpwned.com/
* Use a password manager such as https://www.lastpass.com/business-password-manager

Using Multi-Factor Authentication when the option is available (Signing in with a password and an email to your account with a pin)

Avoid unsecure wifi - If its available, Eduroam is usually a better option than free wifi/cafe wifi


Use a VPN whenever you’re not at work
