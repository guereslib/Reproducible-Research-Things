# Persistent Identifier (PID) or Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)  

## Help people identify you and your work by using ORCID Id's and DOI's for your research work.

A DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a unique identifier that identifies digital objects. The object, itself, may change physical locations, but the DOI assigned to that object will never change. Journal publishers are assigning DOIs to electronic copies of individual articles in journals they publish. 
An ORCID is a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher and, through integration in key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities ensuring that your work is recognized. It can be helpful especially if you may need to change your name later in your career.

Beginner | Ensure data you associate with a publication has a DOI- your library is the best group to talk to for this. <br/>Register for an ORCID id- talk to your library about the best way or go to https://orcid.org/ |
Intermediate | Ensure that your data has corresponding metadata to explain your columns and work.<br/>Populate your ORCID profile with your publications. Add your ID to your email signature so people can easily find you. |
Advanced | Let's get everything polished |
