### Step 6
## Cloud Storage of your Data
---
## Keep a copy of your data on the cloud
---
Keeping a copy of all your data (working, raw and completed) in the cloud is incredbilty important. This ensures that if you have a computer failure, accidently delete your data or your data is corrupted, your research is restorable. 
---
Griffith has three different types of cloud storage made especially for research
---
#### [Research Drive](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/drive/)

This would be a good place for your day-to-day working files. It is unlimited and you can share it with people at Griffith (but not externally). This works the same as G drive.

---
#### [Research Space](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/space/manual/)

This has a ‘sync’ client that automatically copies your files from your computer to the cloud- just like dropbox or google drive. 
You can use this to share with people external to the university. You can add them with a Linkedin profile, Griffith, other university or Gmail account, or you can share with a URL, password and expiry date. This is also unlimited storage- you are given 5GB initially, and to add an unlimited folder, just click ‘Add more storage’. 

---
#### [Research Vault](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/vault/)

For your long term backups. Perfect place to store a safe copy of your raw data or the research of your PhD student who has completed and is leaving the institute.
