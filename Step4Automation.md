### Step 4
## Automation
---
## Can you automate any repetitive tasks? 
---
Often, tasks that need to be done over and over again by a human can be opportunities for human error to sneak in. Setting up an automated way of doing this can eliminate this issue. Anything from an excel formula or macro to coding in a data science frameword can help.
---
### Beginner
Let's thing about the repetitive tasks that you could automate- do you always rename files the same way? Do you manually copy files across?
---
### Advanced

---
Ways you can automate things:
* Spreadsheet Macros and formulas
* MacOS- Automator
* Win 10- Task scheduler
* Microsoft flow or Google script
* Learning to code in Python or R - Talk to your local hacky hour or Software Carpentry people
